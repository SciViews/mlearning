Title: Machine Learning Algorithms with Unified Interface and Confusion Matrices
Description: A unified interface is provided to various machine learning
  algorithms like like linear or quadratic discriminant analysis, k-nearest
  neighbors, learning vector quantization, random forest, support vector
  machine, ... It allows to train, test, and apply cross-validation using
  similar functions and function arguments with a minimalist and clean,
  formula-based interface. Missing data are processed the same way as base and
  stats R functions for all algorithms, both in training and testing. Confusion
  matrices are also provided with a rich set of metrics calculated and a few
  specific plots.
